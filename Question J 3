Comparison:
Power Iteration Technique:

Appropriate for determining the matching eigenvector and greatest eigenvalue.
efficient in terms of computation for big matrices.
If not altered, it might not find every eigenvalue or eigenvector.

QR Algorithm:
Able to locate each eigenvalue's matching eigenvector.
higher processing overhead than Power Iteration.
Ideal for smaller matrices or situations requiring all eigenvalues and eigenvectors
